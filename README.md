# quizzicalTrivia

This is the final solo project I had gladly to do in the Scrimba React.js course. It is a quiz course that use API for new questions each time.
Download it and test your general knowldge, or you can visit this link https://reliable-dango-2f618a.netlify.app/ to try it directly.
Have fun!
I would love any feedback.

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
